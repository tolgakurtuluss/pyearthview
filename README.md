> About Earth View
Earth View is a collection of thousands of the most striking landscapes found in Google Earth. Humans have only been able to see the planet from space for the last 50 years. Yet something encoded in us long ago reacts when we see the world at this unprecedented scale.
The enchanted and sometimes surreal landscapes of Earth View have the ability to elevate our minds from our tiny screens to outer space. Hopefully, this can also move us to care more deeply about our fragile planet.
